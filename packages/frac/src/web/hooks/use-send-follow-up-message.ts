 * Send a follow-up message to the LLM on behalf of the view, as if the user

 * triggers the next assistant turn).
 *
 * Pass `scrollToBottom: false` to keep the chat scroll position when the host
 * posts the message. This option is Apps-SDK-only; it is silently ignored in
 * the MCP Apps runtime.

 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * const send = useSendFollowUpMessage();
 * <button onClick={() => send("Summarize the last 5 results")}>Summarize</button>
